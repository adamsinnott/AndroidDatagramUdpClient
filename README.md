# AndroidDatagramUdpClient
A Datagram UDP client example built using this guide http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/05/android-datagramudp-client-example.html. Can connect to JavaUdpServer https://github.com/adamsinnott/JavaUdpServerClient
Made using Android API 24 version 7 nougat.

I had trouble setting this up using a Virtual device and I did not trouble shoot the issue. The easiest way was to run it on a physical device and then spin up a JavaUdpServer instance and connect to it.

Shout out to http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/05/android-datagramudp-client-example.html for the code. 99% direct copy from that site.
